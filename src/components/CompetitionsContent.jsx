        We have recently reintroduced the Divisional Handicap Competitions to be played sometime in February. There is a Premier &amp; First Division
        Competition one evening and a Second and Third Division Competition another. Player handicaps will be taken from the latest individual ranking
        points and matches will be best of three games first to 21 points.
