## RULES

Annual League

9. The annual league competition will normally begin in September and will be a competition for
teams arranged in divisions as provided below. The Fixtures Secretary will maintain and publish a
running record of match points and results, individual points scores and an individual Merit Table.

1 0. In the event that a situation arises that is not covered by the Rules, or a rule is unclear, or in other
special circumstances accepted by the Committee, the Committee has the authority to make an
overriding decision which is final. This does not constitute a precedent but may become a rule at the
next AGM if considered appropriate.


Teams, Team Secretaries and Registration

11. All players wishing to play in the annual league must be registered in a team of at least three.
Each team must have a designated Team Secretary who shall be the contact point and organiser for
that team but need not play for it. One person may be the Team Secretary for more than one team.
12. All Team Secretaries must provide a telephone number where they can be contacted and an
email address; (email will be the normal way that the Fixtures Secretary sends out and requests
information to and from Team Secretaries). (IMPORTANT NOTE: however you contact each other,
say to cancel or postpone games etc, if you use a text or email you must make sure an
acknowledgment has been given back to you so you know they have received the cancellation
information. Simply sending a text or email and assuming you have cancelled is not acceptable
without confirming they have received it.)
13. Any change of Team Secretary, Venue, Match night, address or telephone number shall be
notified immediately to the Fixtures Secretary. In addition the opposition Team Secretaries shall be
notified as soon as possible
14. Teams from all divisions can have a team of up to eight players registered at any one time,
however teams from within the lowest division may have up to 10 players registered at any one time.
15. Each team shall register sufficient players to enable it to fulfil the entire League season and cup
matches programme.

1 6. Fees (per season) & entry to the league: All Team Secretaries shall forward to the Fixtures
Secretary their entry form indicating the team name, home night and venue, players to be registered,
each player’s individual TTE registration number, and simultaneously send the fees due as indicated
on the entry form to the Treasurer. For teams playing out of the Hyndburn Table Tennis Centre places
at the centre shall be allocated on a first come first served basis. All teams playing from the Hyndburn
Table Tennis Centre will be charged the agreed rate as fixed under 4b above and stated on the entry
form for the season to cover table fees. The Team Secretary shall be responsible for all charges
applicable to his/her team. Fees shall be paid by cheque, payable to “East Lancashire Table Tennis
League”. Where cash is paid, a signed receipt must be obtained.

17.Each division is based normally on having ten teams, each team will play home and away. At the
end of the season the top two teams in each division will be promoted. The bottom two in each
division will likely be relegated depending on the number of teams dropping out or new teams coming
in. If a division has only nine teams then only one would be relegated but two promoted. The
Committee may promote more than two teams in some circumstances and has discretion to decide
where any newly formed teams should be placed as well as putting more than 10 teams in a division if
it deems it necessary. The Committee also has the right (as per rule 18 ) to ‘promote’ any team whose
make up of players through changes or additions to previous seasons, in the Committee’s opinion has
changed their standard sufficiently to be too good for their original division. (NOTE: It will not be
normal practice to demote teams who due to team personnel changes have become weaker, unless
they had been automatically demoted, or at the start of a season were requesting to drop a division
which would be subject to the discretion of the Committee).

18. All players must be registered with both TTE and the League and have paid their membership
fees before taking part in any match. Any player requesting to be registered with the League after the
original entry form has been submitted and after the teams have been set in their divisions will be
subject to approval by the Committee to ensure such a player does not unfairly change the nature of


the competition. Only in exceptional circumstances will any new registrations be permitted after
January 1st; once again the full approval of the Committee is required. The Committee may refuse a
registration or impose limitations if for any reason they think a registration of a player will affect the
spirit of fair competition. If any additional information is found subsequent to this registration the
Committee have a right to impose, at a later date, any conditions that were not imposed at the time of
registration where it is felt a distortion of fair competition has arisen mid-season. (NOTE: At the entry
form stage teams can register any player they choose but the Committee retain the right to judge
what standard and division any particular team should then be placed).

19. During the season any transfers to another team are to be made in writing to the League
Secretary for consideration by the Committee. If approval is given, the player can play for his/her new
team four days later, providing that the transfer takes place before January 1st and no previous
transfer by that player has taken place during that season. No transfers at all may take place after Jan
1st, apart from when a player plays a 6th game as reserve for a higher team and thus becomes
automatically transferred to the higher team as in rule 20 below.

19 a. Any player having a handicap of 6 or less must play at least 25% of the remaining league
matches otherwise any points won will be discounted. Playing in a doubles game does not qualify as
a match.

20. Any team can nominate reserves providing they are from a lower division and have a lower
ranking number than the second highest ranked permanent registered squad player as known from
the latest merit tables published on the league web at the date of the games a reserve is required, (if
in doubt ring to check eligibility of reserve with the Fixtures Secretary before playing). A reserve can
only play for one team per division up to 5 times in a season and will automatically be transferred
permanently to that team after playing 6 matches (and can no longer play from that point on for the
team the reserve had been originally registered with in the lower division). Reserves under this rule do
not have to be registered to the same club and can come from any team as long as they comply with
rest of the conditions above. (Exception for Juniors – see Rule 20b below)

20a. Players can play up for any team as long as they do not exceed more than 5 matches for any
one team and play within the above rules.

20b. Junior players can play up for any team in any division any number of times.

20 c. A team consisting wholly of Junior players may play all their fixtures at their home venue. In the
event that both teams are all Juniors the normal home and away system will apply 21. If a team
resigns from the League, all points will be removed and all monies forfeited.

22. To be included in the final Merit Table a player must play a minimum of 50% +1 of possible league
matches during the season.

Matches and Points

23. The current rules of table tennis as adopted by TTE and LCTTA shall apply to all matches in the
League
24. All matches shall ideally be played on the dates stated on the fixture list. If either team is unable to
field a full team, they may request of the other team that the match is played on an alternative date. If
an agreement to re-arrange cannot be reached between the teams, then it can be referred to the
Committee to arbitrate. The Committee, at their discretion, may order the match re-scheduled, or may
award points to either side depending on the common sense fairness of either the request to re-


arrange, or the refusal to do so. (Note 24a below - no penalty if at least two weeks notice was given)
When awarding points in accordance with this rule; the points for, should be based on an average
over the season; the points against, should be nil.

24a. A match can be postponed without penalty if more than 2 weeks notice is given to the other
team. The opposition Team Secretary must agree to re-arrange the match.

24 b. A match can be postponed without penalty if a team cannot field three players due to a town
team commitment. The opposition Team Secretary must agree to re-arrange the match.

24 c No re-arrangements may be made or requested on the same days as the original fixture date,
save in exceptional circumstances such as inclement weather.

25. Any points won by an unregistered (See Notes on Affiliation and Membership) player(s) will not be
counted nor awarded retrospectively. The opposition will be awarded the points as if that player(s)
had not been present.
26. All matches shall commence no later than 7:30pm. One player must be in attendance at 7:30, the
second player at 8:15 and the third player no later than 8:45 pm. The opposing side can claim the
points of those sets, which could have been played if the opponent had been present. These times
are reduced by 15 minutes for games being played at the Hyndburn Table Tennis Centre. Any
disputes regarding points to be claimed through this rule will be subject to the Committee who will
have the final say on the matter.
27. The Home team shall enter the playing order of its players on the scorecard first, then the away
team. The game should then usually be played in the order of the card with discretion to leave
doubles till the end unless by mutual agreement games are played out of order due to a player being
delayed or someone needs to go early etc but this should not be abused. Either the player name or
the player position, e.g. first, second, third in the team on the night, must be recorded on the
scorecard for the doubles game.
28. The match ball must be approved by both teams prior to the commencement of the match. In the
event that an agreement cannot be reached a new ball must be used.
29. The Home team’s Team Secretary has the sole responsibility to notify the Fixtures Secretary of
the result of the match. Team Secretaries should always endeavour to ensure the scorecard is
returned to the box in the Hyndburn Table Tennis Centre or posted to the Fixtures Secretary or a
scanned copy emailed to the Fixtures Secretary no later than a week after the match was played.
Very late and persistently late offenders may have penalty points deducted at the discretion of the
Committee.
30. In the event of two or more teams having the same number of points at the end of the season,
their positions shall be re calculated and re adjusted by awarding two points for each match won and
by awarding one point for every match ending in a draw. If still the same it will be decided by head to
head statistics over the two games versus each other in the season.

Cup and Other Competitions

31. Players from anywhere in the League can be signed on for a team in a cup match, but they can
only play for one team in a season


32. No player shall be eligible to take part in the semi-final stages of any individual knock- out
competition or team handicap unless he/she has played in at least five league or cup matches in the
current season - with the exception of divisional handicap events, where a minimum of at least two
matches having been played is only required. In team cases, the player cannot have played for a
different team earlier in that season,

Fred Holden Handicap Competition

33 The Fred Holden Competition will be organised during the season. This will be organised on a
team handicap basis. All teams will participate.

33a. Fred Holden Cup matches have priority over the League matches and are counted as due to be
played in the weeks set aside in the programme on the regular home night of the home team at the
home team’s venue, or in the case of the semi-final and final stages in the same week as scheduled
in the programme on a night to be agreed to be played at a neutral venue or at a venue agreed by the
two teams involved.

Other competitions

34. In a group or round robin competition, all members of the group shall compete against each other
and shall gain two match points for a win, 1 point for a loss in a played match and 0 points for a loss
in an unplayed or unfinished match. The ranking order shall be determined primarily by the number of
match points gained. If two or more members of the same group have gained the same number of
match points their relative positions shall be determined only by the results of the matches between
them, by considering successively the number of match points, the ratio of wins to losses first in
individual matches (for a team event), games and points, as far as is necessary to resolve the order. If
at any step in the calculations the positions of one or more members of the group have been
determined while the others are still equal, the results of the matches in which those members took
part shall be excluded from any further calculations needed to resolve the equalities in accordance
with the procedures above. If it is not possible to resolve the relative positions they shall be
determined by lot. This does not apply to Fred Holden Cup matches
